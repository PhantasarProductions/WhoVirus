# WhoVirus


This will be a small game written in Go, playable in the terminal (or command prompt) if you like.
The idea is that you have a file system with 100 files and one of them is a virus, and the others have hints which file that is (but they are all lies). If you run the virus it's game over, if you can succesfully delete the virus you win.

1 point for every file you run to obtain a hint.
10 points for every file you delete while it was not the virus.

Now try to delete the virus with as little points as possible.
