# Screenshots

These are just screenshots you can view for a global idea.
They are not used by the source code, so the Go compiler should ignore them ;)

# Disclaimer

Mac supports wallpapers in the debug console, and I used that feature, and all background pictures you see as a result come forth from the usage of that feature.
The game itself has NO pictures at all, as it's 100% text based.
